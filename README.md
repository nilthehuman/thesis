# Global Illumination Using Continuous Ray Packets

This is my work-in-progress Bachelor's thesis I'm writing at the Budapest
University of Technology and Economics.
I explored a simple and intuitive way to get rid of sampling noise in path
tracing rendering engines. I implemented both [a standard path tracing
application for reference](1) and [one that uses the new algorithm](2).

My advisor is Professor László Szirmay-Kalos.

I apologize for the binary file format but I don't know much TeX at all so
I didn't want to go that way.
