# Global Illumination Using Continuous Ray Packets

This is my Computer Science Bachelor's thesis I wrote at the Budapest
University of Technology and Economics in late 2016.
I explored a simple and intuitive way to get rid of sampling noise in path
tracing rendering engines. I implemented both [a standard path tracing
application for reference][1] and [one that uses the new algorithm][2] (the
latter is unfinished as of December 2016).

My advisor was Professor László Szirmay-Kalos.

I apologize for the binary file format but I don't know much TeX at all so
I didn't want to go that way.
