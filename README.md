# Global Illumination Using Continuous Ray Packets

This is my work-in-progress Bachelor's thesis I'm writing at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.
I explored a simple and intuitive way to get rid of sampling noise in path tracing rendering engines. I implemented both a standard path tracing application for reference[Retra] and one that uses the new algorithm[Silence].

My advisor is Professor László Szirmay-Kalos.

I apologize for the binary file format but I don't know much TeX at all so I didn't want to go that way.
